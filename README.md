## Install checklists

### First install

- Make sure [node](https://nodejs.org/) 2.4 or later is installed.
- Open a terminal and install grunt with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) like this: `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
- If you are familiar with [git](https://git-scm.com/), you can clone from `git@github.com:avdg/screeps.git`.
  - Otherwise you can [get the latest code](https://github.com/avdg/screeps/archive/master.zip) from github.
- Make now sure the terminal is pointing to this project. Then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Build configuration

- Open `settings.js` in an editor (if the file is not available, run `grunt` in console), fill in the options and save the file.
- In a terminal open in a copy of this project: type `grunt deploy`
- If done properly, this should push the code to screeps.com succesfully.

### AI build tricks

- `grunt codegen`: Build generated code
- `grunt deploy`: Pushes code to screeps.com
- `grunt run`: Run the bot in a fake and incomplete simulator
- `grunt test`: To make sure that the code is passing the checks
- `grunt` is currently set to `grunt test`

- `mocha` is available for testing purposes

## `Code` structure

In the current structure there are only 2 files generated for deployment.
The first file is an auto generated main.js, which is the compiled version of
all the extension directories sticked together.
The second file contains settings, allowing to fine tune settings in-game.

`scripts/main.js` is the boot file and is the first user code to be executed,
its being executed once a tick in the screeps sandbox.

Also note that not all code of my current ai are included in this repo.
The private ai code I deploy are just other extensions.

### Ai rules / Ai constrains

- All creeps must have a role, or receive a role after being triggered by the `noRole` event

### AI script files

- `_settings.js` Drain for global AI settings.

#### AI Object

When the autogenerated main.js gets executed, it will expose an `AI` object in global scope.

The AI object has `_settings` included as `AI.settings`, so there is no need to include this file.
It also includes code from extensions accessible from `AI.extensions`.

`_generated` is a generated file that only exists in the `build/deploy`
folder when using `grunt deploy` or `grunt codegen`

### Extensions folder structure

After using `require('_generated')` it will expose the extensions as
`AI.extensions.<type>.<plugin>`.

These files are coming from the `extensions/` directory with a structure as
`extensions/<package>/<type>/<plugin>`.

These include all files ending with `.js`, excluding the files starting with a `.`
like `.thisFileWillBeIgnoredAnyway.js` or located in directories starting with a '.'.

When generating the extensions, all packages are virtually merged into a single package.
This is how it ends up using the `AI.extensions.<type>.<plugin>` format.

Current extension types are:
- commands
   - Located at `extensions/<any directory>/commands/`
   - Executes flag commands
   - Used when called by `extensions/tools/hooks/flags` or `AI.exec(<command>, ...)`
- hooks (replaced units)
   - Located at `extensions/<any directory>/hooks/`
   - Events when hooks are called:
     - `firstTurn`: Called when the AI is doing its first turn
     - `preController`: Called before giving spawns and creepers orders
     - `postController`: Called before shutting down the AI
     - `noRole`: Called when a creep has no role
       - First parameter is creep name
       - Accepts a return value
       - Since an event can trigger multiple hooks, the new role will only be accepted when the received role is non-conflicting (multiple hooks returning the same result is fine, undefined means withold, all undefined means no role).
     - `noSpawn`: Called when a spawn has nothing to spawn
       - First parameter is spawn
       - Second parameter is a function to spawn something, simply pass a type or a creep memory object
- library
   - Contains library functions
   - Module.exports keys are accessible as `AI[key]`
- roles
   - Located at `extensions/<any directory>/roles/`
   - Gives creeps orders
   - Called by stage_creeps, the plugin with the corresponding `Creep.memory.role` will be executed
- routines
   - Located at `extensions/<any directory>/routines/`
   - Place to store routines that can be shared to multiple roles of creeps
   - function routine returns boolean
     - When true it means it has successfully completed its routine
     - When false it means it has not been able to do the routine
- targets
   - Collects or filters to get certain type of objects
   - Usable by `AI.get(target, options)` or `Room.get(target, options)` for getting objects
   - `AI.extensions.target.filter` contains customizable filters
- scripts
   - Used to store scripts, allowing them to be executed later
   - module.exports expects to be a function
   - `AI.extensions.scripts.main` will be executed unless `extensionsBootstrap` is set to `false` at the code generator

#### Ai code

`scripts/main` is the boot file. From there it includes other files in the `script/` directory.
Most of these scripts (called stages) utilizes code from extensions.

#### Bonus: run code after turn
Set `global.run` with a function at wish, and it will be executed after the turn.

For example, this code can be typed or pasted in to the console:

```javascript
global.run = function() { console.log(JSON.stringify(Object.keys(AI))); }

// Or using the es6 arrow syntax
global.run = () => {console.log(JSON.stringify(Object.keys(AI))); }
```

### Call hierarchy

```
 `- Start timer
 `- Run extensions/**/scripts/main.js and friends
 |   `- `stage_setup()` Prepares game state for AI
 |   `- `AI.emit("firstTurn") Triggers firstTurn hook if current turn reboots the AI
 |   `- `AI.emit("preController")` Triggers firstTurn hook
 |   `- `stage_creeps()` Iterates over every creep (give orders)
 |   `- `stage_spawners()` Iterates over every spawner (give spawn jobs)
 |   `- `AI.emit("postController")` Shutdown and triggers postController hook
 `- Stop timer
```

### Notes

- Current tools don't allow es6 features for deployable code.
    * UglifyJS2 simply doesn't support es6
    * Blanket isn't upgraded to a version with es6 support
    * Note that test cases and live code can be written using the new es6 syntax as they don't depend on these tools
